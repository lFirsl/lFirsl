## About Me
🧑‍💻 Final-year MSci Computer 
Science (Cloud Computing) student at the University of Leeds, with a 
First-Class BSc and a year of industry experience as a Full-Stack 
Software Engineer at Unity. Driven by a deep curiosity to understand and
 contribute to systems end-to-end—from designing intuitive UIs to 
architecting backend services and cloud infrastructure. 

🏢
 At Unity, as part of the [Player Engagement](https://unity.com/solutions/engage-players#player-engagement) team, I contributed to 
the [Unity Gaming Services](https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services) dashboard using React, Kotlin, and C#, built scalable services 
on GCP, and practiced CI/CD and TDD in agile teams. I also led the 
development of the [Push Notifications SDK](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/manual/push-notifications/manual/sdk) for the Unity Game Engine.

🎓
 Academically, my paper [Foveated Animations for Efficient Crowd 
Simulation](https://lfirsl.github.io/foveated-animations-project/) was published and presented at [I3D 2025](https://i3dsymposium.org/2025/), following an 80/100 
grade in my BSc final year project. I'm currently working on a 
benchmarking framework for container orchestration schedulers as part of
 my MSci research.

🎮 Personally, I’ve served on the committee 
for the [University of Leeds eSports and Video Games Society](https://engage.luu.org.uk/groups/H37/esports-and-video-games), organizing 
weekly events and managing university eSports teams for UK-wide 
tournaments.

I'd describe myself as a:

🧱 Principled 
engineer – I focus on building maintainable, testable systems grounded 
in core design and engineering practices. Thanks to a strong foundation 
from university, I can confidently learn new tools and frameworks as 
needed—because I understand the principles beneath them.

🧠 
Curious Fast-Learner – I quickly ramp up on new technologies by taking 
on tasks outside my comfort zone; at Unity, I became an independent 
contributor within weeks despite starting with no prior experience in 
their stack.

🤝 Collaborative Communicator – I keep teams aligned
 through clear async updates, raise blockers early, and proactively seek
 feedback; this approach was key to delivering stable, production-ready 
features at Unity.

🔧 Adaptive Problem-Solver – I focus on 
building iteratively and delivering real value; for example, I refined 
Unity’s Push Notification SDK based on developer feedback, ensuring 
long-term stability and usability, 

🔁
 End-to-End Contributor – I take ownership from concept to deployment; 
in my published research on foveated animations, I designed, 
implemented, tested, and optimized the underlying foveation system from 
scratch.
